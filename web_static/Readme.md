This project involves developing the front end of an AirBnB objects management system step-by-step, focusing on designing static HTML pages. The initial steps include creating simple HTML static pages, a style guide, and incorporating fake contents. The development process explicitly excludes JavaScript and loading data from external sources.

The learning objectives of the project include understanding HTML and CSS languages, with HTML as the structure of the page and CSS as the styling. The emphasis is on fixing the HTML structure before applying any design, as design relies on a solid underlying structure.

Before commencing the project, participants are instructed to fork or clone the "AirBnB_clone" repository from their partner if they were not the original owner of the previous project.

The provided resources guide participants in learning HTML and CSS, covering topics such as creating lists, inline styles in HTML, CSS specificity, HTML introduction, CSS basics, and centering boxes.

Learning objectives also encompass general concepts such as understanding HTML, creating HTML pages, recognizing markup language, understanding the Document Object Model (DOM), comprehending elements/tags, attributes, and how browsers load webpages. Additionally, participants are expected to grasp CSS concepts, including adding styles to elements, understanding classes, selectors, computing CSS specificity values, and comprehending box properties in CSS.

The project imposes certain requirements, including using specific editors (vi, vim, emacs), adhering to W3C compliance and validation, organizing files into specific folders (styles for CSS, images for images), and avoiding the use of certain CSS features like !important and id (#...). Restrictions also include refraining from using certain HTML tags (img, embed, iframe), avoiding JavaScript, and maintaining compatibility with Chrome 56 or newer, without considering cross-browser compatibility.

Lastly, the project underscores the importance of meeting these requirements independently, discouraging plagiarism and warning that any form of plagiarism will result in removal from the program. Participants are required to provide a README.md file in the project's root folder.
