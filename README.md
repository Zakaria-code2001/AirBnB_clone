# AirBnB_clone
THE AIR BNB CLONE

Welcome to our AirBnB clone project! In this exciting work, we'll lay the foundation for a web application by building a command interpreter. This interpreter is essential for managing our Airbnb properties including users, states, cities, locations, and more.
This is what we do together:

Building the BaseModel Class:
We'll kick things off by crafting a parent class named BaseModel. This class will be responsible for handling the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of our instances.

Setting Up Serialization/Deserialization Flow:
Let's establish a straightforward flow for serialization and deserialization. We'll be working with instances, dictionaries, JSON strings, and files to make our data management seamless.

Creating AirBnB Object Classes:
We'll design classes for the various objects within AirBnB, like User, State, City, and Place. It's important that these classes inherit from our BaseModel class.

Developing the Abstracted Storage Engine:
Next up, we'll create the initial abstracted storage engine, focusing specifically on file storage. This engine will be the powerhouse behind storing and retrieving our precious objects.

Crafting the Command Interpreter:

Here comes the heart of our project â€“ the command interpreter. Think of it as a personalized shell for managing AirBnB objects. With this interpreter, we'll be able to:
Create new objects (User, Place, etc.).
Retrieve objects from various sources (files, databases, etc.).
Perform operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.).
Update attributes of objects.
Destroy objects.

Ensuring Reliability with Unit Tests:
To make sure our code is robust and dependable, we'll create thorough unit tests. These tests will validate the functionality of all classes and the storage engine.
Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
